# MDP and Bellman Equations

Notes:
* Although we define ordering over policies it is important to note that it is only a _partial ordering_, and it's quite easy to come up with an example that breakes an idea of complete ordering. (TODO: think of MDP where all pairs of policies are not orderable, and thereby no optimal policy exist)
