A Journey to Reinforcement Learning

This repository would contain code and solutions to various exercises from RL textbooks and courses and also serves as a playground for implementing some RL algorithms.
It is mainly inspired by @dennybritz [awesome repository](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning) and thereby organized in a similar way.
